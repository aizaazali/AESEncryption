AES is an encryption mechanism that can be used to perform both encryption (converts plaintext to ciphertext) and decryption (converts ciphertext to plaintext). Here you can find different modes of AES encryption - ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB. 
These programs are to demonstrate how each mode is different from one another and what happens to the plaintext (or ciphertext) when certain bits of either a key or a ciphertext (or plaintext) are manipulated.

Note: 1) The key and the Initialization Vector (IV) have been hardcoded and can also be generated at random if necessary. 
2) The ciphertext is encoded to hexadecimal('hex') format because the virtual machine I worked on did not display the ciphertext properly. Hence I had to encode it into 'hex' format.
